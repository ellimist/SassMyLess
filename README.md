# SassMyLess

SassMyLess is a small utility that converts a folder containing LESS files to SCSS files

## Disclaimer

Because of the way LESS and Sass work, it's not possible to make this process fully automatic, so it's likely that a bit of manual work might be required.

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install SassMyLess

## Usage

    $ sassmyless path_to_less_folder path_to_sass_folder
